# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:

####     Have you ever wished you could reach for a resource that would give you the highest quality, most awe-inspiring, and that feel good feeling like, you-just-recieved-a-hug-from-the-cosmos-itself, type of feeling? Then this is the app for you! This app will fetch an affirmation when you need to manifest the future but, you just don't know how to put it into words. It can deliver a mantra so powerful that when you chant it, the etheral noise will cease its relentless howling immediately! Oh; that's not the probelm you say? You have all the affirmations and mantras you need? You just don't have a way to capture those insightful moments when the celestial pilliars of the universe deliver unto you an axiom so profound, so applicable; but you just don't need it at that moment? Boy then I've got good news for you! This app allows you to add your own words of power to the already potent pool of legendary language and let the paracausal forces, pluck the underpinning strings of our physical reality and deliver their words to you when you need them most! You may not control what storms the solar winds throw your way; but you can harmonize with their frequencies with this very application!

### Context:

#### So at this point, we are into the 3rd week of our first module however I am a repeater at this points as well so I brought some prior exposure to this project. Cumulative total for the time would probably be; 15 hours over the course of 5 days.

### Contributors:

#### This was a solo project so it was me, myself, and I! Charles T. Banks, Jr.   https://github.com/DRIF7ER

### Learning Goals:

#### So the learning goals for this project were (with my brevity applied to them in the description I am about to give): - gain expirience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, - write HTML and CSS to match a comp, - understand listeners and user events, - individualize our programming skills. I can confidently say I touched on all of those in my work with this project! I used primarily VS to write the programming and codepen.io to iterate features and get immidiate feedback.

### Wins + Challenges:

#### For me the fact that I was able to not only produce something that works but, make something that I have no reservations about slapping my name on is the most epic win. I made this whole thing and what's better is that I understand every aspect of it's appearance and functionality.
####     I am also so stoked about figuring out how to flip between 2 elements and disable one as you use another. That's a super cool part of this thing. It was also the most challenging part for me to figure out how to make work becasue I had to do a good bit of research to build the logic to make it work lol.
